					<h2 id="mainHeading">Rostov, Russia</h2>
					<p id="testP" class="funParagraph"> I was born in Rostov, Russia in 1997. I spend the first nine years of my life in Russia. I really liked living in Russia back at the time. Rostov was a really cold city, but we really went along with the community.</p>

					<h2>Krasnodar, Russia</h2>
					<p>I've lived in multiple different cities in Russia. After I lived in Rostov, my family decided to move to Krasnodar. Kransodar was a very beautiful city. It was very well developed and structured.</p>

					<h2>Saint Louis, MO</h2>
					<p>After we moved away from Russia, my family moved to Saint Louis. It was a very difficuly transition to come to the United States of America. It was such a major different city and environment. We didn't even know the language at the time, but we were able to adapt to the United States after some time.</p>
